      <p>“Man you’re really successful with your music, right? Look, you’d have way more success if you made pop… y’know?”</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Hm… should I really start making pop music? Would I be more successful? They want to help, right? Do they know what’s best for me? Do they know me better than I do myself? Those are the questions I used to ask myself (a lot).</p>
<p>There’s this simple theory that if you want to help someone do it by listening, not assuming. It’s a pretty big step to accept the impostor feeling; and an important one it is. But don’t stop there please.</p>
<p>What happens after that is equally important, if not more. After you accepted it, start thinking. Ask yourself, with the confidence that only you know the answer, why do I feel like one? Maybe people think of you as more as you do yourself? Go deeper, go further than is comfortable. If you have someone that truly knows how to listen, talk to them about it. You’re worth it!</p>
<p>As to me, I realized that I felt like an impostor because people put me on a pedestal that I didn’t want to be on. Instead of asking, “how did you get there?”, most of people just assumed (or imagined) my existence as a musician and then wrongfully proposed solutions to me. Thanks for trying, but no. </p>
<p>Nowadays, I fully embrace the warmth of the compliments I get and also thank people for it. What I don’t do anymore though is question my own motivations, beliefs and morals for doing what I do. If somebody assumes that they know what’s best for me I just kindly ask them: Do you really?</p>
