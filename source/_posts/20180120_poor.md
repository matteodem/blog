I'm kinda poor. Not poor as in I can't get anything to eat poor. But poor as in, my existence is about to be shit if I don't earn more money.

<!-- more -->

You might think that in a city like Zurich, it'd be really hard for me to admit it. But for some reason, in a city full of people obsessed with money and status, I couldn't care less. What's the point of earning as much money as you can? Suckers.

I wanna get out of this situation. And I want everybody that's in a similar situation too. I'm trying so hard to earn money without helping a system that's just straight fucked up. It's hard. Without destroying nature. Without helping a gigantic corporation grow. Without feeling useless.

And also... fuck money. It's way too important for how much there actually is out there. Hi Bill Gates. What's up Jeff Bezos? Wanna share? Anyways I hate it.
