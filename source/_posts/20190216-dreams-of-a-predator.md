They’re never what we think of them
They love to answer, they hate to question
<!-- more -->
They know what’s best for others, just trust them
They dominate because that’s the right thing to do
Nature is nothing but another problem to them
Never attempt to unmask their distortion
Their ultimate dream is to be killed
They won’t get what they want
